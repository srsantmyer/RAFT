# UPDATED MODIFIED README 2023-04-19
--------------------------------------
Originally forked from the Cognizant Reusable Automation Framework for Testing repo, this project has been re-created to break that fork link.
Following the stated goal of this framework and the newer MAQS framework, the code in this repo is designed to be a starting point so that the wheel does not need to be re-invented over and over again when starting a new automation project.

## HIGH LEVEL CHANGES
---------------------
* Cucumber and Keyword Driven projects are removed. You can find them with the original Cognizant code
* Modular Driven project is moved to the root of this repo
* Dependencies are updated to latest as of February 2023
* Additional changes will be noted at the head of modified files
